# Simple-interest-Calculator
This repository showcases my very first projects as I begin my Android development journey.
This is a basic Android app that functions as a Simple Interest Calculator. It allows users to input the principal amount, time in years, and rate of interest to calculate simple interest. The app also provides options to reset the input fields, calculate the simple interest, and display the calculated result.

## Features

  - Time in Years (integer)
  - Rate of Interest (float, in percentage)

- **Buttons:**
